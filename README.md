## Rules

Congratulations! You are now the newest employee of the greatest diner in the world! We are proud to have you on our team. :smile:
Your goal is simple, tend to the customers who come in the restruant.
You need to seat them, take their order, and give them their check (sort of like diner dash, but better!).
Here are a couple things to note:

- Every customer who comes in is thirsty and hungry
- Their thirst and hunger levels will be added to your stress levels
- You can serve them whenever you like and give them a check whenever you like!
- Giving them food makes you and them less stressed
- Checking them out makes you and them less stressed AND if you served them, it gives you money!
- THE TRICK IS THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW HUNGRY OR THIRSTY THEY ARE!
- OR how much money they are going to spend
- The only way to figure these things out is to ask them
- But once you ask, or serve them, or check them out, BE READY!
- Another customer is already at the door.
- If you get too stressed or the restruant gets too full, it's GAME OVER!

### Starting up

First, you will be asked in a prompt whether or not you have played the game before.
If you have played before:
- Good news! We can probably find your info and you can try to beat your high score.
If this is your first time playing:
- You will have to create a username.
- Then, you will be asked if you would like the rules explained.

Now the game begins...

## GamePlay

### Step One: A customer arrives

As an employee of the West Taghkonic Diner, you must tend to any new customers who arrive!
- Find a table for this new customer to sit at of the available tables
    *P.S. There are only five tables available!*
- Try and stay alert! You will be quickly prompted how much stress the new customer adds


### Step Two: Get to know, Take an order, Give a receipt

Here, you have a few choices (but you can only pick one!)

1. You can get to know a customer:
    Feel free to mingle with any of the customers!
    If you speak to them, they will tell you how hungry/thirsty they are
    They will also tell you how much their items cost

2. You can take a customer's order:
    Even if you don't know what the customer wants, you can go ahead and take their order.
    You can only take one order: meal or drink
    This should lower there stress

3. You can check the customer out:
    Here, you can give the customer the check.
    If you were able to complete any orders of theirs, you will get the money for those items back.
    If you didn't, that's okay!
    Your stress will still go down based on however stressed the customer was

### Step Three: REPEAT!

After you complete one of the available actions in Stage Two, the cycle will begin again!!
Back to Step 1! Keep the restruant moving! Make that money!

### GAMEOVER

The game is over when your stress hits 50 or above OR if all five tables are full.
Count your cash and pat yourself on the back!
